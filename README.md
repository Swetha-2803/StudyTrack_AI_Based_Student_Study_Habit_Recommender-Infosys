## Project Overview

Students often do not clearly understand how their study habits affect academic performance.  
This project analyzes student behavioral and academic data to identify patterns, predict performance, and recommend optimized study strategies.

The system combines data analysis, machine learning models, and an interactive dashboard to provide actionable insights.
